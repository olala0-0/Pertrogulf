Multi Branch Invoice & Accounting
========================================
Run several operating units (branches) inside one company and keep their
accounting separated. A branch can be set on customer invoices, vendor bills,
credit notes, refunds, journal entries, journal items, payments, bank statement
lines and receipts. Branch level record rules make sure a branch user only sees
its own data while a branch manager sees everything. Includes optional branch
wise document numbering, a branch performance dashboard and full audit tracking.
